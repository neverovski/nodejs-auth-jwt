This project, titled "Basic Authentication for Nodejs", is a comprehensive authentication solution built with Node.js. It includes features such as user authentication, token refresh, user logout, password reset, and user management (creation, update, deletion).

Additionally, it supports authentication through various platforms including Facebook, Apple, Google, and Github. Twitter and LinkedIn are planned for future integration.

The project also includes a Swagger documentation.

## Notes

### 1. Enable Git hooks

```
  npx husky install
  npx husky add .husky/commit-msg 'npm run commit-msg'
  npx husky add .husky/pre-commit 'npm run pre-commit'
```

### 2. Why is my git pre-commit hook not executable by default?

- Because files are not executable by default; they must be set to be executable.

```
  chmod ug+x .husky/*
  chmod ug+x .git/hooks/*
```

### 3. Git commit

```shell
  npm run commit
```

### 4. Project release

```shell
  npm run release:patch // Patch release 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1
  npm run release:minor // Minor release 0.1.1 -> 0.2.0
  npm run release:major // Major release 0.2.0 -> 1.0.0
```
