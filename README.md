This is a sample Node.js application comprehensive API including features such as user authentication, token refresh, user logout, password reset, and user management (creation, update, deletion).

Additionally, it supports authentication through various platforms including Facebook, Apple, Google, and Github. Twitter and LinkedIn are planned for future integration.

The project also includes a Swagger documentation.

## API Documentation

The REST API exposes its OpenAPI. You can view the API definition interactively using the Swagger UI, hosted at /docs. Simply start the server and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5858/docs](http://127.0.0.1:5858/docs) in your browser to access the Swagger UI.

Alternatively, you can explore the [online version of the API documentation](https://neverovski.github.io/nodejs-rest-api/) without running the server.

## Installation

Development environment requirements:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) >= 20
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) >= 24
- [Docker Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Project initialization

### 1. [LOCAL] stage use docker-compose command
```sh
  cp .env.dev .env
  docker compose up -d --build
```

### 2. Migration
```sh
  npm run migrate:create --name=<NAME>
  npm run migrate:run
```

## Notes

### 1. Enable Git hooks

```sh
  npx husky install
  npx husky add .husky/commit-msg 'npm run commit-msg'
  npx husky add .husky/pre-commit 'npm run pre-commit'
```

### 2. Why is my git pre-commit hook not executable by default?

- Because files are not executable by default; they must be set to be executable.

```sh
  chmod ug+x .husky/*
  chmod ug+x .git/hooks/*
```

### 3. Git commit

```sh
  npm run commit
```

### 4. Project release

```sh
  npm run release:patch // Patch release 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1
  npm run release:minor // Minor release 0.1.1 -> 0.2.0
  npm run release:major // Major release 0.2.0 -> 1.0.0
```
